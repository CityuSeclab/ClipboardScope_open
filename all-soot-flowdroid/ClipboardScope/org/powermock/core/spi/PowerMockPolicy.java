/**
 * This interface can be implemented to create policies for certain frameworks
 * to make it easier for users to test their code in isolation from these
 * frameworks. A mock policy implementation can for example suppress some
 * methods, suppress static initializers or intercept method calls and change
 * their return value (for example to return a mock object). <i>A mock policy
 * implementation must be stateless</i>. The reason why there are two methods
 * for applying settings is that PowerMock needs to know which classes that
 * should be modified by the mock class loader <i>before</i> these classes have
 * loaded. The {@link #applyClassLoadingPolicy(MockPolicyClassLoadingSettings)}
 * tells PowerMock which classes that should be loaded and then the
 * {@link #applyInterceptionPolicy(MockPolicyInterceptionSettings)} is called
 * from the mock class-loader itself. This means you can create mocks for e.g.
 * final and static methods in the
 * {@link #applyInterceptionPolicy(MockPolicyInterceptionSettings)} which would
 * not have been possible otherwise.
 * <p>
 * Since mock policies can be chained subsequent policies can override behavior
 * of a previous policy. To avoid accidental overrides it's recommended
 * <i>add</i> behavior instead of <i>setting</i> behavior since the latter
 * overrides all previous configurations.
