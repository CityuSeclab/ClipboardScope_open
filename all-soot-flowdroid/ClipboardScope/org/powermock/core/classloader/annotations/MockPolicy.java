/**
 * A Mock Policy can be used to make it easier to unit test some code with
 * PowerMock in isolation from a certain framework. A mock policy implementation
 * can for example suppress some methods, suppress static initializers or
 * intercept method calls and change their return value (for example to return a
 * mock object) for a certain framework or set of classes or interfaces.
 * <p>
 * A mock policy can for example be implemented to avoid writing repetitive
 * setup code for your tests. Say that you're using a framework X that in order
 * for you to test it requires that certain methods should always return a mock
 * implementation. Perhaps some static initializers must be suppressed as well.
 * Instead of copying this code between tests it would be a good idea to write a
 * reusable mock policy.
