/**
 * This annotation tells PowerMock to prepare certain classes for testing.
 * Classes needed to be defined using this annotation are typically those that
 * needs to be byte-code manipulated. This includes final classes, classes with
 * final, private, static or native methods that should be mocked and also
 * classes that should be return a mock object upon instantiation.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can be placed at both test classes and individual test
 * methods. If placed on a class all test methods in this test class will be
 * handled by PowerMock (to allow for testability). To override this behavior
 * for a single method just place a <code>&#064;PrepareForTest</code> annotation
 * on the specific test method. This is useful in situations where for example
 * you'd like to modify class X in test method A but in test method B you want X
 * to be left intact. In situations like this you place a
 * <code>&#064;PrepareForTest</code> on method B and exclude class X from the
 * {@link #value()} list.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you need to prepare inner classes for testing, this can be done by
 * suppling the fully-qualified name of the inner-class that should be mocked to
 * the {@link #fullyQualifiedNames()} list.
 * <p>
 * You can also prepare whole packages for test by using wildcards:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;PrepareForTest(&quot;com.mypackage.*&quot;)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The annotation should always be combined with the
 * <code>&#064;RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)</code> if using junit 4.x or
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public static TestSuite suite() throws Exception {
 *     return new PowerMockSuite(MyTestCase.class);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * if using junit3.
 * <p>
 * The difference between this annotation and the {@link PrepareOnlyThisForTest}
 * annotation is that this annotation modifies the specified classes and all its
 * super classes whereas the {@link PrepareOnlyThisForTest} annotation
 * manipulates <i>only</i> the specified classes.
