/**
 * Use this annotation to suppress static initializers (constructors) for one or
 * more classes.
 * <p>
 * The reason why an annotation is needed for this is because we need to know at
 * <strong>load-time</strong> if the static constructor execution for this
 * class should be skipped or not. Unfortunately we cannot pass the class as the
 * value parameter to the annotation (and thus get type-safe values) because
 * then the class would be loaded before PowerMock could have suppressed its
 * constructor.
