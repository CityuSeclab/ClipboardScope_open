/**
 * Sfl4j mock policy that injects a Mockito-created mock to be returned on calls to getLogger factory methods.
 * The implementation returns a single mock instance per thread but it doesn't return a different mock instance based
 * on the actual value passed to getLogger. This limitation is acceptable in most real uses cases.
 * <p/>
 * Tests that want to do verifications on the mocked logger can do so by getting the mocked instance as production code
 * does: {@link org.slf4j.LoggerFactory#getLogger(Class)}. However, it is critical that the mocked logger is
 * reset after each test in order to avoid crosstalk between test cases.
 * <p/>
